# SchoolProjects

This repo contains a few school projects that I had worked on. 
The first project is a 3d graphics program. It is written in C++ and uses a library that my teacher had given us to simplify drawing. I beleive it was a openGL wrapper class, and we used that to project 3d objects onto the screen using simple draw line functions.
The second project is a PHP based web app. It was made for a non profit organization to manage thier employee reviews. 
The third app is a simple simulator for a dice game called Pig. It was written in Ruby and is a basic command line application.
