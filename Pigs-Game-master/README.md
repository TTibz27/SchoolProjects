# Pigs

These are a few simple dice games created by me and a partner for my computer languages class.
It is fairly simplistic project, but I feel as though it shows that I have a grasp of the basic Ruby syntax. 

PigGame and PigHold are playable games of the dice game pig, with a few minor alterations.
PigProb and PigProb2 calculate the probabilities of the dice games.
