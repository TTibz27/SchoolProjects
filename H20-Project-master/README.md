# H20-Project

This was a group project that was created for our Software Engineering class for the non-profit organization Heart Heaven Outreach.]

Our project was to develop a system for employee evaluations. The employees were required to give a self evaluation, and the employers were to be able to evaluate any employee.'
we created a login system using php, and we also implimented bootstrap in order have the evaluations be moble friendly.

We ran out of time with this project and were not able to debug the entire system, but I feel as though it is a good example of team coding that I have worked on.
