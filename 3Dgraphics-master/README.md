# Cplusplus-3Dgraphics

This is the final project I created for my 3d graphics class.
The included class is the object itself, references to the viewport, and all of the transformations preformed on the class.
There was another class that was used to draw the object to the screen, but it contains alot of references to the private libraries
that were given to us by our instructor, so I did not include them.

This project shows some c++ code that I have created that can store 3d point data, rotate the points across the x,y and z axes, 
zoom into the world coordinates, translate the viewport, clip to the viewport, and project the 3d points into 2d points using perspective projection.

The code listed is not executible as it stands, I will work on a class that will draw this object onto the screen.
